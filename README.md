# Tamu Orgs Mails

A simple web application built in Django to gather all the recognized students organizations at Texas A&M and their emails in one database. The data is scrapped from [StuAct page](https://stuactonline.tamu.edu/app/search/index/index/search/name?q=).

## Installation
If you wish to install this application locally on your machine to make some changes, follow the steps below.

1. Clone the repository into your local machine.
2. Create a Python virtual environment (recommended, but optional). You can follow the guide [here](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/). Activate the virtual environment if you have created one.
3. Install the packages required for this project by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` (make sure you are in the correct directory).
4. After the required packages have been installed, run the application using `python manage.py runserver`.

This should run the server on your local machine and any changes you make will reflect in the web application. Read more about Django at [Django docs](https://www.djangoproject.com/start/overview/).
